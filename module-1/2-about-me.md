# About me and why I'm qualified

Hello, I'm Krishiv. I'm a high school student with an unhealthy love for cool tech. I spent pretty much the entirety of last year tinkering with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. I have a homelab that cost me nothing becuase I used old laptops that I would never have used anyways.

My most impressive accomplishment, however, is probably the fact that I often speak at events. I have spoken at Kubernetes Austin and I got invited to speak at Devops Days Austin. This course is just a fun little side project for me. I hope you enjoy it!
