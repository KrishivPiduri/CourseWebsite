# What makes this course unique?
As mentioned before, I've been through my fair share of bad online courses. If nothing else, I know what not to do when it comes to building courses. While I'm not Kubernetes expert, I know what it feels like to be in your shoes.

I know that looking for the right course is annoying and I know that, for some reason, the most boring courses are the ones that people say are the best. I know the feeling lof watching all the videos in a module and realizing you were just tuned out the entire time. This course is the solution to your problems.

### What this course won't do

I've built this course to be engaging, informative, and most importantly, fun. I want you to be excited to learn about Kubernetes and I want you to be able to take what you learn and apply it to your own projects. I want you to be able to walk away from this course and say "I know Kubernetes" and I want you to be able to say it with confidence.

That being said, let's be clear on what this course doesn't do. This course is not a deep dive into Kubernetes. That being said, if you are looking to be a Kubbernetes expert, this course is a great place to start. Not only will I give you the tools you  need to get started, but this course will also let you get your hands dirty with Kubernetes in a way that most courses don't.
