# Coming soon...
This website will soon hold a video course on Kubernetes for the Rest of Us. Until then, you can browse through the lesson notes.

Kubernetes is a very difficult technology. I started diving into Kubernetes when I was 12. Since then, I've tried many ways to learn more about it, but all the courses out there are really boring. So I decided to create my own course, which will be fun and easy to understand. And that's how K8s for the Rest of Us was born.
